# My Principles

I consider these to be inviolable.

## Honesty
I do not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do.

## Integrity
I would rather lose than cheat to win. I value the spirit of the game as well as the letter of the rules. If I don't like the rules, then I will work to change them rather than break them.

## Humanity
Everyone deserves to be shown dignity and compassion, without exception.

# My Values
These are things I hold in balance and are sometimes in conflict.

## Knowledge
I appreciate the act of study, regardless of domain. One cannot achieve directed progress without a sense of history. Facts exist and should be shared.

## Curiosity
One should want to know more about how things work. Breadth is as valuable as depth.

## Thoroughness
There is always more that can be done.

## Kindness
I treat others as I'd like to be treated. 

## Diversity
Having different experiences and perspectives focus a problem, they do not complicate it. I support any person who shares purpose with me.

## Empathy
EQ > IQ. I strive to understand where other people are coming from and how they are feeling, and acknowledge that they may have a different experience than mine. This should inform the products I produce as well as the way I interact with others.

## Resilience
I will not give up in the face of adversity. When my path is blocked, I will look for another way.

## Teamwork
I cannot achieve my goals alone, nor would I want to. Working with others produces a better product, and should be more fun.

## Transparency
I protect privacy and devalue secrecy. Contributions can come from surprising places when everyone has the same information. 

## Versatility
I want to survive the zombie apocalypse. I have a few specialties but strive to be good at many things. I like to be able to jump in and help wherever I can.

# My Aspirations
These values are incredibly important to me, but I struggle with them. I strive to get better every day.

## Candor
I appreciate straightforward and direct feedback, even when that is difficult. Confronting issues directly lies in tension with my general tendencies towards amiability and is sometimes hard for me, but I recognize that if I truly care about someone, then the kindest and most useful thing I can do is give my unvarnished opinion.

## Bravery
I strive to find the courage to do what is right, even if others will laugh at or threaten me. By definition, bravery means you're in a threatening situation, and if this ever feels easy, it means you're not putting yourself at enough risk.

## Humor
I wish I was someone who was quick with a joke (and a light for your smoke), but can be a little reserved. I love to have fun, and think that laughter makes the world a better place. I need to work on bringing more of it into the world.
