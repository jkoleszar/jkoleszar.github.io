  <article class="prose prose-indigo prose max-w-3xl">
    <hr />
<h1 id="my-principles">My Principles</h1>
<p>I consider these to be inviolable.</p>
<h2 id="honesty">Honesty</h2>
<p>I do not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do.</p>
<h2 id="integrity">Integrity</h2>
<p>I would rather lose than cheat to win. I value the spirit of the game as well as the letter of the rules. If I don't like the rules, then I will work to change them rather than break them.</p>
<h2 id="humanity">Humanity</h2>
<p>Everyone deserves to be shown dignity and compassion, without exception.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="my-values">My Values</h1>
<p>These are things I hold in balance and are sometimes in conflict.</p>
<h2 id="knowledge">Knowledge</h2>
<p>I appreciate the act of study, regardless of domain. One cannot achieve directed progress without a sense of history. Facts exist and should be shared.</p>
<h2 id="curiosity">Curiosity</h2>
<p>One should want to know more about how things work. Breadth is as valuable as depth.</p>
<h2 id="thoroughness">Thoroughness</h2>
<p>There is always more that can be done.</p>
<h2 id="kindness">Kindness</h2>
<p>I treat others as I'd like to be treated. </p>
<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>
<p>Having different experiences and perspectives focus a problem, they do not complicate it. I support any person who shares purpose with me.</p>
<h2 id="empathy">Empathy</h2>
<p>EQ &gt; IQ. I strive to understand where other people are coming from and how they are feeling, and acknowledge that they may have a different experience than mine. This should inform the products I produce as well as the way I interact with others.</p>
<h2 id="resilience">Resilience</h2>
<p>I will not give up in the face of adversity. When my path is blocked, I will look for another way.</p>
<h2 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h2>
<p>I cannot achieve my goals alone, nor would I want to. Working with others produces a better product, and should be more fun.</p>
<h2 id="transparency">Transparency</h2>
<p>I protect privacy and devalue secrecy. Contributions can come from surprising places when everyone has the same information. </p>
<h2 id="versatility">Versatility</h2>
<p>I want to survive the zombie apocalypse. I have a few specialties but strive to be good at many things. I like to be able to jump in and help wherever I can.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="my-aspirations">My Aspirations</h1>
<p>These values are incredibly important to me, but I struggle with them. I strive to get better every day.</p>
<h2 id="candor">Candor</h2>
<p>I appreciate straightforward and direct feedback, even when that is difficult. Confronting issues directly lies in tension with my general tendencies towards amiability and is sometimes hard for me, but I recognize that if I truly care about someone, then the kindest and most useful thing I can do is give my unvarnished opinion.</p>
<h2 id="bravery">Bravery</h2>
<p>I strive to find the courage to do what is right, even if others will laugh at or threaten me. By definition, bravery means you're in a threatening situation, and if this ever feels easy, it means you're not putting yourself at enough risk.</p>
<h2 id="humor">Humor</h2>
<p>I wish I was someone who was quick with a joke (and a light for your smoke), but can be a little reserved. I love to have fun, and think that laughter makes the world a better place. I need to work on bringing more of it into the world.</p>
